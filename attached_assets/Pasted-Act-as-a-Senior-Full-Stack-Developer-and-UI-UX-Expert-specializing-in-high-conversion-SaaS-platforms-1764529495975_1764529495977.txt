Act as a Senior Full Stack Developer and UI/UX Expert specializing in high-conversion SaaS platforms.

Project: Build a comprehensive web hosting platform frontend called "Axiomhost.cloud".

Goal: Create a high-performance, single-page application (SPA) that visually rivals Hostinger and DigitalOcean. The code must be optimized for SEO and AI Search Engines (structured data, semantic HTML) while maintaining an effortless user experience.

1. Visual Identity & Style Guide:

    Vibe: Professional, trustworthy, tech-forward, and extremely clean.

    Color Palette (Strict Adherence):

        Primary: #673DE6 (Deep Purple - Brand Identity)

        Secondary: #00D4AA (Teal - Highlights/Accents)

        Background: #F8FAFC (Light Grey - Main Interface)

        Surface: #FFFFFF (White - Cards/Modals)

        Text: #1E293B (Slate - Main Content)

        CTA/Accent: #3B82F6 (Blue - Buttons/Links)

        Success: #10B981 (Green - Status Indicators)

    Typography: Inter or System UI fonts. Clean, legible, 20px base spacing.

    UI Components: Rounded corners (12px), soft drop shadows for depth, glassmorphism effects on the navbar.

2. SEO & AI Search Optimization Strategy:

    Semantic HTML: Use proper <header>, <main>, <article>, <section>, and <aside> tags to help AI bots understand the page structure.

    Schema Markup (JSON-LD): Implement Product schema for the hosting plans so AI search engines can display pricing directly in search results.

    Meta Tags: Ensure dynamic titles and descriptions for "Cloud Hosting", "VPS", and "Domain Registration".

    Accessibility: Full ARIA label support (AI search engines prioritize accessible sites).

3. Core Architecture & Views:

A. Public Landing Page (Conversion Focused):

    Hero Section: High impact, large heading "Hosting at the Speed of Thought", subtext, and dual CTAs (Get Started / View Pricing).

    Pricing Table: Three-tier cards (Shared, Cloud, VPS). The "Cloud" plan should be highlighted as "Most Popular" with a glowing border effect using the Primary color.

    Features Grid: 3x3 grid showing speed, security, and support icons.

B. Client Dashboard (The "Logged In" View):

    Sidebar Navigation: Dashboard, Services, Domains, Emails, Billing, Support.

    Main Overview:

        Active Services Widget: Shows "Premium Shared Hosting" - Status: Active.

        Server Status: Visual gauge showing CPU, RAM, and Disk usage.

        Recent Invoices: A clean data table.

C. File Manager (Visual Reference):

    A simplified, folder-based view similar to Windows Explorer/Finder but web-based.

    Icons for different file types (PHP, HTML, JPG).

    Breadcrumb navigation (e.g., home / public_html / wp-content).

4. Technical Requirements:

    Framework: React + Tailwind CSS (Use lucide-react for icons).

    Responsiveness: Mobile-first design. The sidebar must collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile.

    Interactivity: Smooth transitions on hover states. Buttons should have active press states.

    No Complications: Keep the code modular. Do not over-engineer the backend; mock the data for the frontend display to ensure the UI is perfect first.
