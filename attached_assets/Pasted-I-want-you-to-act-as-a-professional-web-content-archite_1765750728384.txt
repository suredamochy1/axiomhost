I want you to act as a professional web content architect and designer. Your task is to create a fully integrated website by gathering, compiling, and optimizing content from two sources: Hostinger.com and sirstevehq.com.

       * Heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
       * Alt text for all images
       * Internal linking between relevant pages
   - Ensure content is accurate, up-to-date, and free from plagiarism.
