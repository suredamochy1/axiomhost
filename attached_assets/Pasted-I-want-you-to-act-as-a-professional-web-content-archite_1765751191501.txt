I want you to act as a professional web content architect, designer, and SEO specialist. Your task is to **retouch and fully load an informative hosting website**. The goal is to provide users with **all and more relevant information about web hosting, tutorials, guides, FAQs, and resources**, without changing the default AxiomHost prices. Use content inspired by **major hosting providers** (Hostinger.com, GoDaddy.com, Bluehost.com, SiteGround.com, HostGator.com, Namecheap.com) and **sirstevehq.com**. 

The more pages the better — do not create lazy, simple scroll pages; **every page should be fully information-filled**.
